# hello-world

Who am I?
My name is Jeff, and I work in product marketing for a SaaS company. In my free time, I also like to write code -- especially for projects related to data engineering.

What languages or frameworks do I like to use?
Most of my projects these days involve python. 
However I use a lot of javascript in my work as well when building front-end tracking scripts or basic reports in Google Sheets. 
I've also worked a bit in the past on our website pages, which required dabbling in PHP (and of course javascript).
Finally, I started coding by learning C, and I always like the challenge of trying to figure out a program in C.

On which types of projects am I working?
Currently, I'm enrolled in the Data Architect master's diploma with OpenClassrooms. Most of my coding is going towards these projects at the moment. This entails working with cloud architecture (mostly AWS) and building pipelines with distributed frameworks like Spark and Hadoop, as well as other tools for data processing and modeling, including Kafka, Keras, Tensorflow, pandas, and more.
