# hello-world

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
My name is Jeff, and I work as a Data Engineer for a SaaS company called Shipup. In my free time, I also like to write code -- especially for projects related to data engineering.

<h3>What languages or frameworks do I like to use?</h3>
<p>Most of my projects these days involve python and SQL. I also have experience using javascript in my work building front-end tracking infrastructure or custom UDFs. I've also worked substantially with Wordpress websites, which required PHP knowledge (and of course javascript). Finally, I started coding by learning C, and I always like the challenge of trying to figure out a program in C.</p>
